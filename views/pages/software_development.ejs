    <ul>
      <li>Databases: Turn your Excel spread sheets into effective databases</li>
      <li>Web Portals: Create a user-friendly cloud-based intranet, extranet or portal for your employees or customers</li>
      <li>Integration: Easily access data from your website, mobile app or database</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, I have extensive experience with from-scratch software development projects as well as editing and upgrading existing systems.</p>

    <h2>Stages of Development</h2>

    <p>When working with you to develop a functional piece of software, I not only offer implementation but everything you need to bring your project to fruition, including;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Research and Planning: Evaluating the needs of your project, analysing what else is out there, and making note of any possible downfalls in the project prior to development.</li>
      <li>Analysis: As I spec out your software, I will analyse how it works and, working with your internal teams, ensure it will perform exactly as you need it to day-to-day.</li>
      <li>Design: Development isn't just about data. It's also important that the system we create is easy for your staff to use and manage.</li>
      <li>Development: By this stage, considering everything we'd mapped out previously, we will begin importing your data to see that everything's working correctly.</li>
      <li>Testing: After the first stage of development is completed, it's essential that we test your system vigorously to iron out any bugs before it goes live.</li>
      <li>Maintenance: Once we've set everything live and you're using your software, I can work with you to undertake regular maintenance and upgrades to keep your system up-to-date and functioning without a hitch.</li>
    </ul>

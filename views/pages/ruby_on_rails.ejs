    <h3>What is Ruby on Rails?</h3>
    <p>Rails is a web-application framework, that is predominately used to create database-backed web applications. It uses the principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller). The Rails framework helps developers to build websites and applications, because it abstracts and simplifies common repetitive tasks.</p>

    <h3>Why choose Rails for your project?</h3>
    <p>There are a variety of pros of using Rails to develop your web application, including;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use of MVC principles, which means your application can easily be extended and amended</li>
      <li>Quick to develop, taking a fraction of the time of more complex frameworks and therefore saving cost, too</li>
      <li>Promotes rapid application development (RAD), which means you will receive a proof of concept quickly, which you can then feedback on and test vigorously prior to go-live</li>
      <li>Versatile with readable code, which means you can switch between developers easily, internally or externally, without any hiccups
      <li>It's open source, so you don't need to worry about licensing costs that come with other frameworks</li>
    </ul>

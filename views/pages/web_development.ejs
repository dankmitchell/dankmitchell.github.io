    <h1 class="page__title">Web Development</h1>

    <p>Web development is about more than just pretty pictures. It's about how your customers, and prospective customers, find you, interact with you and enquire with or purchase from you. It's about showcasing your business, your products and your
      experience clearly, in a way that makes your audience think of you first next time they want to buy or book. That's where I come in.</p>

    <p>I have years of experience as a freelance web developer in Essex and London, during which I've worked with some of the UK's leading businesses, including the likes of Barclays Bank, TUI Group and The Telegraph, as well as in the public sector
      for the Department of Education, for instance.</p>

    <p>Just some of the development services I offer include;</p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>

    <p>I follow a six-step process when designing and developing websites:</p>

    <h2>Stages of Development</h2>

    <p>When working with you to develop a functional piece of software, I not only offer implementation but everything you need to bring your project to fruition, including;</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Research: Who is your customer and what do they look for in a website?</li>
      <li>Spec: Between us, we'll get an idea of what your website should look like and the purpose(s) it must serve.</li>
      <li>Conceptualisation: I will provide you with some initial design ideas which, once agreed upon, I'll develop.</li>
      <li>Feedback: Nothing's spot on first time, so we'll take some time to figure out where there are issues and I'll fix them.</li>
      <li>Testing: When you're happy with your design and everything's in place, together, we'll run a testing phase where any bugs around functionality will be picked up.</li>
      <li>Go-live: When you're completely happy and we're confident there are no issues with your website, I can hit the go-live button!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Better still, I can deliver your website using a content management system (CMS) of your choice or with my home-grown CMS, which I specifically designed for ease, flexibility and efficiency so that you, or anyone in your business, can update
      your website effortlessly. Whicheverâ€™s easiest for you.</p>

    <h3>Get started</h3>
